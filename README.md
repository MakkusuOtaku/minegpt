# MineGPT
Minecraft bot controlled with an LLM.

## Features
- Understands natural language
- Follows instructions
- Customisable personality
- Not evil (tested on Windows)

# Usage
## Installation
You'll need to install the following:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer)
- [mineflayer-pathfinder](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer-pathfinder)

## Running
Once you have the code and its dependencies installed you'll need to do the following:
- Set the port number for your server in `index.js`
- Put an OpenAI API key into `key.txt`
- Run `index.js` with NodeJS
- Idk, I think that's everything

## Controlling
You can have conversations with the bot just by sending messages in the chat.
To make the bot physically do things you have to give it an instruction starting with an exclamation.

`!look at me`

This is likely to change in the future.

# How it works
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I made a [video](https://youtu.be/V_WEoMoU6wo) about it.
