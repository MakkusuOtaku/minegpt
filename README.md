Minecraft bot controlled with an LLM.

## Features
- Understands natural language
- Can do some things
- Not evil (tested on Windows)

## Usage
Once you have the code and its dependencies installed you'll need to do the following:
- Set the port number for your server in `index.js`
- Put an OpenAI API key into `key.txt`
- Run `index.js` with NodeJS
- Idk, I think that's everything

## How it works
    ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
